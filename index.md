# Sparking Conversation

2020 has become a watershed year, not least due to the pandemic. Instead of bringing the world community closer together in the face of a shared global threat, we have become further divided across national, racial and ideological lines. How then, in this era of identity politics, can we leverage diverse and international perspectives to generate new thinking and new solutions? How can we come together to solve the big challenges of our time? 

## More information does not equal more understanding

While we have more information at our fingertips than ever before, there is also ever greater disagreement around big, important societal issues. It is undeniable that the Internet has leveled the playing field around obtaining information throughout all strata of society. However, greater access and the ease of publishing information online has also made it easier for misinformation to flourish.

At the same time, society is growing more complex. We are confronted daily with issues that very few of us really understand, from the COVID-19 pandemic, to climate change, equity and racism, and the role of government. These aren’t easy issues to grapple with, and because there aren’t simple answers, it is easy to come away feeling disempowered. As a result we often understandably turn inward, looking for affirmation from family, friends, and our echo chambers on social media.

Retreating into our social bubbles where we aren’t challenged in our beliefs has been leading to a hardening of positions around the issues and a slow migration towards the extremes. The views we hold seem increasingly irreconcilable with dissenting views from the other side. Finding common ground seems extremely difficult, if not impossible. Further perpetuating the segmentation of society into smaller and smaller groups and tribes, identity politics has been ensuring that nearly everything these days is becoming politicized.

## The lost art of conversation

Clearly the polarization of societies all over the world isn’t helpful. It is leading to civil unrest, evidenced by what we have witnessed in our cities this year. In this “us against them” world, how can we possibly hope to move forward?

When I think back to my education in the early nineties in Germany, one of the things that I remember about it is that there existed a culture of dialogue and discussion. Germany of course is a country that has had to reckon with a troubled past. As the kids of baby boomers, my classmates and I were two generations removed from the holocaust, yet the topic was still very much front and center in German schools. There was the prevailing notion that the past—however traumatic—needed to be dealt with so we could move forward as a country. With something as singularly horrifying as the holocaust, which led to the deaths of 6 million Jews and many millions more, the question of how a country and a people could move forward was huge and overwhelming. As a result, discussion around politics, philosophy, and ethics was heavily emphasized.

Since that time, I have always believed that dialogue is imperative. Yet today, we have increasingly fewer opportunities for discussion across different points of view.

The only hope of finding common ground lies in our capacity to have an intellectually honest, fact-based dialogue. We must find a way to have civil conversations again. It is the only way that we can ever hope to come together and find solutions to the problems that ail us.

In order to have a dispassionate, productive conversation we need to start from a position of agreement. We need the ability to unwind an issue back to its fundamentals. This includes looking at the data, as well as listening to a range of personal perspectives to understand different lived experiences and points of view. Both may enable us to frame an issue in an objective and more inclusive way.

## Design can help

As those who practice design know, the design process excels at bringing people together and listening to diverse points of view in order to understand topics from a multitude of different perspectives. We frequently collaborate across disciplines in order to solve problems. In a sense, we are mediators.

Designers are also in a unique position in that we are makers. We create things. And we solve problems through making. It is in our power to create artifacts that spark conversation through an honest representation of the facts, as well as enabling the ability to see and understand the different perspectives surrounding a topic.

If putting artifacts into the world can help stimulate dialogue, it is not only about making information available, but also about creating engaging and widely accessible experiences that can pull people in on an emotional level. We can lean on universal metaphors to create experiences that people from various cultural backgrounds can relate to, such as spatial metaphors that mirror the way we perceive the physical world. And it is also on us to ensure that information is presented objectively, in a way that people can come together in agreement before discussing varying outcomes and approaches.

By creating a more inclusive alternative to the forces that divide us, design may present a possible way forward out of our current stalemate.
